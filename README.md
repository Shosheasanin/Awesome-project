This repository hosts the collaborative work of our university group project, focused on Team 3.
The aim of this project is to the goal of learn how to do problem solve instantly about setting up a environment friendly industry.
Our group consists of four members. students from Finland(IIT),Kazakhstan(IIT),Chaina(IIT) and me from Bangladesh(IIT).
And this repository serves as the central hub for our development efforts.
When we first receive the topic we felt overhelmed & of course it was the first time we were working together.However, our mindset was to do the team work perfectly.
So in this perspective we started assemble our ideas what came to our mind.Afterwords we organized them, sketched out a rough framework and then proceeded to discuss and refine the details.
Although the process was smooth active and helpful as well.
